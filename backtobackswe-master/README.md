- 📹 Intuitive Video Explanations
- 🏃 Run Code As You Learn
- 💾 Save Progress
- ❓New Unseen Questions
- 🔎 Get All Solutions

<b>Some Topics A Software Engineer Probably Needs To Know To Pass A Big N Interview:</b>

- Fundamentals of Computer Systems (just a general knowing how computers store information etc.)
- Big O Time & Space Complexity Computation
- Arrays
- Primitives
- Strings
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion / Backtracking
- Graphs
- Greedy Algorithms
- Hashtables
- Linked Lists
- Sorting
- Searching
- Min/Max Heaps
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees, Binary Trees, & Binary Search Trees
- System and OO design Principles (sometimes)

And that is pretty much it for Data Structures & Algorithms.

Back To Back SWE's goal is to contribute to the community of people bridging
these topics to help engineers excel in the interview.

It has nothing to do with us. We are just here to communicate the ideas.

We are only humble teachers.

If even one person gets an offer from our work, our day is complete.
